=====================

Tablix module to detach Teachers from Event definitions on School Timetabling Problems

Introduction
------------
This Piece of code extends the capabilities of Tablix (www.tablix.org) to use it to design the teacher assignment on top of all the other standard features the distribution included modules already do.

Usage
-----
In the example folder there is an xml file which will work on tablix if you add the module to your library.

For further information on adding modules, please refer to the tablix documentation notes on the tablix web page.

If any problem is found during compilation, there is a spot in the wiki with things to try: https://github.com/jmanart/Tablix_SubjectTeacher/wiki/Tablix-Setup
